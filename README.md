# google-homepage

This is a project to show basic skills.

The idea is to clone the google homepage without giving it any functionality.

I will use Sublime Text and  the dev tools in google chrome to help me complete this project.

Ok, so I have finished the project. It was a lot harder than I thought but I got there in the end.

The Inspect tool on Chrome was invaluable and helped me immensely.

I learnt a lot and will continue to take what I have learnt and grow from there.
